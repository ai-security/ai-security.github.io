            <p><span>The team (member: Inho Hahn, Wontae Jang) in the Lab
was awarded Special Prize at 2013 Korea Cryptography Contest on November 14,
2013. Korea Cryptography Contest is one of prestigious contests which are organized
by both KISA (Korea Internet &amp; Security Agency) and NSRI (National Security
Research Institute), and sponsored by both NIS (National Intelligence Service)
and MSIP (Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning). Participating in the
contest for the first time, the Lab showed its potential in regard to
information security. The contest mainly consists of two areas, problem solving
based on cryptanalysis/cyber security techniques and research papers for
information security. The team participated in the first area. The team members
