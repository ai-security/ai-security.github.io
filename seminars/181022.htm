                <p style='margin:0 20 0 40px;'><span>In this talk, I introduce the recent trend of the post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms that have been actively researched recently. 
                In addition, I will introduce the PQC standardization by the NIST of United States and explain the basic principles of code-based cryptography and lattice-based cryptography actively discussed in the standardization process. 
                In code-based cryptosystems, cryptographic algorithms using both the Hamming metric-based codes and rank metric-based codes have been proposed. 
                Using some representative algorithms, I will explain the main structures of those algorithms. 
                On the other hand, most of the lattice-based cryptosystems are designed based on the learning with errors (LWE) problem and the main structures of individual algorithms are substantially identical with small differences. 
                Therefore, the basic design principle of each algorithm will be explained based on the original LWE problem.</span></p>
