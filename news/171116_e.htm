	  		<p><span>Ji Hoon Han in the Lab was awarded Grand Prize at 2017 Graduation Exhibition Contest on November 16, 2017. 
            Graduation Exhibition Contest is annually organized by Student Association for Department of Computer and Information Communications Engineering and sponsored by Department of Computer and Information Communications Engineering. 
            In the contest, students compete vigorously with their systems which have been developed based on their four-year learnings and skills. 
            Based on deep learning algorithms which are recent AI technologies, Ji Hoon developed a system which can automatically diagnose lung cancers with a high accuracy. 
            Lung cancer is very notorious for its high misdiagnosis rate in the medical area. Ji Hoon has been advised under both Prof. Seong Oun Hwang and Kyung Hyun Han, the Lab leader.</span></p>
