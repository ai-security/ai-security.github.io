                <p style="font-size:10pt">This is the&nbsp;hands-on experience program for both designing and programming of mobile apps open to primary, middle and high school students. The goal of this program is to increase students' interest and exposure to STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics). Working with team advisors in the teams of 3-4 members, students design and create innovative apps that incorporate STEAM principles and various technological elements (sensors, interfaces, functions) in mobile phones.</p>
                <p style="font-size:10pt">The goal of primary school students is to design and create casual game apps using basic functions including acceleration sensors embedded in mobile phones. The goal of middle and high school students is to design and create innovative multi-modal musical instrument apps, which are limited to have at most two buttons and should play percussion (e.g., drum, tambourine) as well as keyboard instrument (e.g., piano, melodean) at the same time.</p>
