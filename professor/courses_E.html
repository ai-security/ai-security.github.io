    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b><span style="font-size:12pt;">Course Overview</span></b></p>
    <p><span>This course will cover the theory and
    practice of computer and information security, including topics such as network
    security, systems security, Web security, and cryptography with its
    applications. After completing this course, students will be able to perform
    cyber attacks and corresponding defenses. Furthermore, they will be able to analyze,
    design, and build secure systems that are essential in our daily life.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b><span style="font-size:12pt;">Experimentations</span></b></p>
    <p><span>To perform cyber attacks and defenses in
    real, physical environment which is very similar to, but isolated from our
    Internet, we provide our testbed which comprises open source networking
    equipments as well as commercial off-the-shelf ones:</span></p>
    <ul>
        <li><span>CISCO routers (Cisco2911/K9, Cisco1921/K9)</span></li>
        <li><span>CISCO switches (WS-C2960G-24TC-L, WS-C2960-24PC-L, WS-C2960-24TC-L)</span></li>
        <li><span>CISCO APs (AIR-AP1142N-K-K9)</span></li>
        <li><span>Open source routers/switches equipped with <a href="http://www.netfpga.org">NetFPGA</a> cards</span></li>
        <li><span>Traffic generators</span></li>
        <li><span>Operating systems (Ubuntu, CentOS, Backtrack, WinXP, etc.)</span></li>
        <li><span>Server systems (Web/DNS/SIP/SMTP/RTSP server etc.)</span></li>
    </ul>

    <p><span>We also provide a large emulated type of testbed by joining <a href="http://www.deterlab.net">DETERLab</a>.
        In this testbed, students can experience the followings:</span></p>
    <ul>
        <li><span>DDoS attacks </span></li>
        <li><span>Worm modeling </span></li>
        <li><span>Exploits, intrusions, forensics </span></li>
        <li><span>Man-in-the middle attacks </span></li>
        <li><span>Botnets</span></li>
    </ul>

    <p><span>Based on the fundamental concepts of cryptograpy, students can also design and build their own secure systems using
        <a href="http://www.openssl.org">OpenSSL</a> toolkit:</span></p>
    <ul>
        <li><span>Setting up a CA (Certificate Authority)</span></li>
        <li><span>Advanced programming with SSL</span></li>
        <li><span>Building symmetric and asymmetric encryption systems</span></li>
        <li><span>Building OTP (one-time password) system</span></li>
    </ul>
