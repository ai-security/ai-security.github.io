  <p style='font-size:22.50pt;'><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;About IEEE Student Branch</b></p>
    <p><span>An IEEE Student Branch provides opportunities to meet and learn from fellow IEEE Student and Graduate Student Members and engage with professional IEEE members locally. An active IEEE Student Branch can be one of the most positive elements of your academic career, offering programs, activities, and professional networking opportunities that build critical skills outside of the classroom.<br></span></p>
    <p><span>IEEE Student Branch of Gachon University seeks to enhance the learning experience of the student community on the campus. The Student Branch focuses on conducting social and technical activities for students, and also encourages the students to take full advantage of the benefits of IEEE membership, including scholarships, competitions, and conference grants. The Student Branch also intends to provide opportunities for students to network with peers in other institutes, academicians, professionals, engineers, and scientists through the on campus IEEE Student Branch and the Local IEEE Section, thereby encouraging students to be a part of the global IEEE community
<br></span></p>
    <p><span>IEEE Student Branch is a platform to grow and excel where you can learn from each other and the community. Recently, a team from our BK project conducted a survey about the research activities and hurdles faced by the project group members. 
    One of the main issues is related to writing the paper which revolves around writing the English language, research methodology, networking within the groups and with the community, and so on. In order to address these issues, we want to utilize the Student Branch platform to train the students to overcome their deficiencies, whether they are related to writing papers or conducting research. 
    We have intensive plans to build a stronger network with experts in the fields and will conduct seminars and workshops for the enhancement of student skills. As the research process can never be done alone, so take this as an opportunity to build your expertise in research. I hope you will join us in this self-development process and we all will learn from the experts and also from each other.</span></p>
