                <b>Time:</b> 05:00 pm<br>
                <b>Place:</b> AI Building, Room 511<br>
                <b>Details:</b> Professor Hyung Chang from Birmingham University will deliver a special lecture on the topic mentioned above. Please join to align your research with the latest trends in AI.<br>
		<b>Abstract:</b> Computer vision research is one of the hottest fields these days. Focusing on research keywords that are recently presented in top-tier conferences, we will look at the current research trends, and not only the research topics but also the trends in research methodologies. 
                Also, I will share my know-how how to write papers to be submitted to top-tier conferences (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, etc.) that have been made through my own experiences, and how reviews are conducted at the top conferences. 
                Besides, various tips for conducting computer vision research and creating research networks will be introduced.<br>
		<b>Bio:</b> Dr. Hyung Jin Chang is an Associate Professor in the school of computer science at the University of Birmingham and a Turing Fellow of the Alan Turing Institute. Before joining the University of Birmingham, he was a post-doctoral researcher at Imperial College London and received his PhD degree from Seoul National University.
                His research combines multiple artificial intelligence areas, including computer vision, machine learning, robotics, and human-computer interaction. His research career started focusing on theoretical aspects of machine learning, and it has converged on applying these aspects to more practical problems in visual surveillance, HCI, and robotics, with an emphasis on estimating human eye gaze, hand pose, body pose, kinematic structure, and 6D object pose etc.
                Recently, his research has focused on exploiting and making advances in computer vision and learning techniques to move toward intelligent human-robot/human-computer interaction based on visual data.<br>
